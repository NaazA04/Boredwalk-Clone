# 📝 Boredwalk Clone Website Project 

---

## 📌 1. Problem Statement

The fashion e-commerce market is overloaded with brands that feel repetitive, lifeless, or overly commercial. For users who feel different, bold, or quirky, there are very few platforms that let them feel seen or celebrated. Boredwalk, with its mission to express attitude and celebrate weirdness, needed a website that captured this spirit.

However, the original site design was lacking:
- ❌ No **Home button**, creating poor navigation.
- 🎨 A **basic, uninspired color palette** that didn't reflect the brand's quirky tone.
- 🧱 Lack of features that promote Boredwalk as a **lifestyle community**, not just a clothing store.

> ✅ The project aimed to redesign the user experience with improved structure, visual branding, and emotional connection.
